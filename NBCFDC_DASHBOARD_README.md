# NBCFDC Credit Scoring Dashboard

## Problem Statement ID: 25150
**Beneficiary Credit Scoring with Income Verification Layer for Direct Digital Lending**

A comprehensive dashboard solution for the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment (MoSJE) to implement AI/ML-based credit scoring for NBCFDC beneficiaries with income verification through consumption patterns.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Ensure loans reach genuine, low-income beneficiaries with good repayment behavior
- **Performance Target**: Reduce processing time for repeat borrowers by 50% or more  
- **Automation Goal**: Enable same-day sanction for high-score beneficiaries through direct digital lending

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Convex (serverless backend-as-a-service)
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control
- **Database**: Convex real-time database with automatic scaling
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization with multi-stage builds

### Core Components

#### 1. **Beneficiary Management System**
- Complete beneficiary profiles with KYC documents
- Demographic information and category classification (SC/ST/OBC)
- Channel partner integration for data collection
- Status management (active/inactive/suspended)

#### 2. **Credit Scoring Engine**
- **Repayment Score (60% weight)**: Based on historical payment behavior
  - On-time payment ratio
  - NPA history analysis
  - Average delay calculation
  - Repeat borrower bonus
- **Income Score (40% weight)**: Consumption-based income verification
  - Electricity usage patterns
  - Mobile recharge frequency and amounts
  - Utility bill payment patterns
  - Government socio-economic survey data
- **Composite Score**: Weighted combination with explainable factors

#### 3. **Risk Classification System**
Four-tier risk band classification:
- **Low Risk-High Need**: Ideal candidates for concessional lending
- **Low Risk-Low Need**: Eligible but lower priority
- **High Risk-High Need**: Requires manual review
- **High Risk-Low Need**: Typically rejected

#### 4. **Digital Lending Module**
- **Auto-Approval Logic**: 
  - Minimum score threshold: 70/100
  - Maximum auto-approval amount: ‚Çπ2,00,000
  - Approved purposes: business, education, skill development, equipment
- **Processing Time**: Target <60 seconds for auto-approved loans
- **Interest Rate Determination**: Risk-based pricing (4%-8%)
- **Manual Review Queue**: For complex cases requiring human intervention

#### 5. **Income Verification Layer**
Multiple data sources for comprehensive income assessment:
- **Electricity Consumption**: Usage patterns and bill amounts
- **Mobile Usage**: Recharge frequency and amounts (anonymized)
- **Utility Bills**: Water, gas, and other utility payments
- **Survey Data**: Government socio-economic datasets
- **Asset Information**: Household assets and ownership patterns
